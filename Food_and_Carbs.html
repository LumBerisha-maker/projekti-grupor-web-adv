      Rice and Meat

      <h3>Rice is a cereal grain and in its domesticated form is the staple food of over half of the world's 
      population, particularly 
      in Asia and Africa. Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice)</h3>

     Oats and berries

     <h3>The combination of oats and berries has been a staple in many health-conscious individuals’ diets for years.
      The idea of pairing the fiber-rich, comforting goodness of oats with the antioxidant-packed, sweet flavor of berries 
      seems like a match made in heaven. But is this 
     pairing truly beneficial for our health, or are there some underlying concerns that we should be aware of?</h3>

     Milkshakes

    <h3>People often associate protein milkshakes with a less-than-desirable texture 
     and taste. However, that doesn’t have to be the case. With a little creativity and experimentation in the kitchen, 
     it’s possible to create rich, smooth, and indulgent protein milkshakes that are perfect for fueling up after a workout or as a
      quick snack on-the-go. These shakes can be 
     just as decadent and sweet as your favorite ice cream-filled treats, minus the added calories and guilt. People often associate protein milkshakes with a less-than-desirable texture
